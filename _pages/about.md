Hi there! I am a biologist with broad interests specialising on plant evolution.

Born in the north-west of Germany (Westphalia), I went to Franconia (Bavaria) to study biology in [Würzburg](https://www.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de), because they had the topics that fascinated me a lot at the time: tropical biology (around KE Linsenmair), social insects / ants (around B Hölldobler), and they were the only place in the world studying *Triphyophyllum*, a rare carnivorous plant (organic chemists around G Bringmann). After a few years, I could indeed explore some of these topics in greater detail! The chance to work on the ecology and biomechanics of one of my favourite plants, *Nepenthes*, arose, and so I went to do field work in Borneo, Brunei Darussalam, with a group of insect adhesion researchers from Cambridge, UK. As the chance arose, I spent an ERASMUS year during my master thesis (*Diplomarbeit*) at [Cambridge](https://www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/research/groups/insect-biomechanics), with another field season in Brunei Darussalam.

I then decided to do a PhD in [Zürich](https://peg.ethz.ch/), because the *unlikely* chance arose to study population genomics in *Nepenthes* and resolve the mystery of genetically stable species co-existence in the face of hybridisation and introgression. Thus I got hooked on evolutionary biology, ecological genomics, sex chromosomes, and bioinformatics. I discovered that even invisible sex chromosomes can be really easy to detect in a certain type of sequence data. Diving deeper into the fascinating realm of sexuality and mating systems in plants, I continued to [Lausanne](https://www.unil.ch/dee/pannell-group) for a first PostDoc with *Leucadendron*, a plant genus with very strong sexual dimorphism.

I became a father and in 2021, I returned to Germany for another PostDoc at [Potsdam](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/ibb-genetik/index). Here I study the molecular-genetic basis, development and evolution of heterostyly in *Amsinckia* - the curious case of different kinds of flowers in the same population! In fact, the heterostyly mating system involves supergenes, which are similar to sex chromosomes in may ways.
