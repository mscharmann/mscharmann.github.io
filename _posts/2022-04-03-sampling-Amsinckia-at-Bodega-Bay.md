Sampling for my current Postdoc project along the Pacific coast of California included some pretty locations! This is me at Bodega Head, standing on top of a creeping mat of *Amsinckia spectabilis* just a few centimeters tall. Evidently, these plants are tough and found a way to resist the permanent wind and salt spray. Further inland, populations of the same species grow erect, and this is at least partially genetic. Local adaptation at its best!
