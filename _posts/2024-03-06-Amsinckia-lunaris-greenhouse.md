title: a greenhouse full of *Amsinckia lunaris*

---


*Amsinckia lunaris* is a rare wildflower from central California. 

Unlike other *Amsinckia*s, it has not just one or two different kinds of flowers in the population but three. There are short-styled morphs, long-styled morphs, and an odd morph with short styles but the anthers inserted at two different levels in the flower: the "partial homostyle" (pH) morph. To udnetsnd the genetics of this weird situation, we raised about 300 plants from controlled crosses in the greenhouse in August 2023.

... and flowers of a "partial homostyle" morph, with three anthers visible high up ion the corolla tube. The other two anthers are hidden below, just at the height of the (also invisible) style/stigma.
