I am raising lots of different *Amsinckia* accessions at Uni Potsdam for cytogenetic tests, and these plants generally look the best when they are just starting to flower. This is the chance to get some beauty-shots in the photo studio.

Among the most beautiful plants are *Amsinckia furcata* and its sister lineage *Amsinckia vernicosa*. Here in the side-by-side comparison, one can clearly see the remarkable difference in flower size between the highly outcrossing and heterostylous *A. furcata* on the left, and the highly selfing, homostylous *A. vernicosa* on the right. Apart from the flowers, the obvious phenotypic differences are minor: both species have thick glaucous epicuticular wax which helps them to survive well into the hot and dry season from their winter-growing life history in desert-like regions of western central California. The hypothesis to test is that heterostyly is ancestral, but the *vernicosa* lineage lost it and instead evolved homostylous, tiny flowers for efficient self-pollination and reproductive assurance.
